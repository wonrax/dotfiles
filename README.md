- Run install.sh to install the dependencies and config files
- Things must be done manually after install:
    - Install tmux if not present, then install tmux plugin manager and the
    plugins by pressing `prefix + I` while inside tmux
    - Install Cascadia Code NF fonts which is required by my alacritty config
    and can be found here: https://github.com/microsoft/cascadia-code
    - For neovim, some plugins may require go so please do install it:
    https://go.dev/doc/install

Todos:
- install.sh: the script to install zsh plugins on fresh machine is not working
